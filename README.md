<h1>Unfinished Towndown RPG Project</h1>
My last hobby project from PhaserJS
I won't be using Phaser anymore but this is one of my last projects I tried to experience in for learning how to make a top down rpg with basic mechanics at least?<br>

I made a short video showing what it looks like and what I accomplished.
